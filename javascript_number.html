<h1> JavaScript Number</h1> 

<p> JavaScript has only one "number attribute, wherein the number is expressed in terms of variables. We find that in JavaScript, we can only equate numbers of values upto 2^52, or -2^52. That is about 16 decimal digits, which is enough for most cases, but we require BigInt in the event we need to represent more than 16 digits, for purposes like extra accurate timestamps that are expressed in microseconds. 

We  can perform the following basic mathematical operations in JavaScript, 
<ol> 
<li> Addition  </li> 
<li> Subtraction </li> 
<li> Multiplication </li> 
<li> Division </li> 
</ol> 

In the event that a given procedure goes wrong, then the worst case scenario output given out by JavaScript is NaN. JavaScript Numbers has provisions for positive Infinity, and negative infinity as well. </p> 

<p id = "para1"> We find that numbers can be expressed with or without decimals. </p>  
<script>
var x = 3.123;
var y = 400;
document.getElementById("para1").innerHTML=x + "<br>" + y;
</script> 

<br> </br> 

<p id = "para2"> In order to represent extra small or extra large numbers can be expressed in terms of exponential notation. Positive exponentials are used to represent extra large numbers, whereas negative exponentials are used to represent extra small numbers. 

<script> 
var r = 2404e5;
var w = 345e-7;
document.getElementById("para2").innerHTML = r + "<br>" + w;
</script>
